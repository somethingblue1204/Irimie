<h2>About me</h2>Hello web!
<p>I'm a 23 year old girl called Irim from South Korea. I have two dogs. A boy called Coco and a girl called Ruby.
I'm not working at the moment, expecting to work as a computer engineer.
But unsure if i can, however, whatever! it's okay not to work as it.
<strong> I just want to <u>do what I want</u>.</strong></p>

I like BTS, <a href="https://www.noelgallagher.com/" target="_blank" title="Noel Gallagher's official website">Noel Gallager</a>, dogs, food. lol</p>
